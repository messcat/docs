1. **Scan with WhatsApp:**
    - Open WhatsApp on your mobile phone.
    - Go to **Settings** > **Linked Devices**.
    - Tap on **Link a Device**.
    - Point your phone's camera at the QR code displayed on your Messcat screen to scan it.

## **What Happens Next**

After you scan the code, Messcat will start syncing with your WhatsApp. Wait about **5 to 10 minutes** for your chats and contacts to show up. If you have lots of contacts or old messages, it might take more time.

## FAQs

### **Why does it say "Waiting..."?**

**Answer:** This means Messcat is still loading your old chat messages. Please wait. **Don't worry or scan the QR code again and again.** Scanning again won't make it faster.

### **Why don't Read/Unread marks match sometimes?**

**Answer:** Sometimes WhatsApp doesn't tell Messcat right away when you read a message. Because of this, the read/unread marks might not always match perfectly between WhatsApp and Messcat.

## Helpful Tips

### **Using More Than One Channel?**

If you link several WhatsApp numbers, **give each channel a clear name** (like "Sales Team" or "Support Line"). This helps you know which channel is which.
