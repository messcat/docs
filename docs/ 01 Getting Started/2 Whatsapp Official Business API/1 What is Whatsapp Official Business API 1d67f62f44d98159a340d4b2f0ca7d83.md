# What is Whatsapp Official Business API?

## Types of WhatsApp Accounts

### 1. Personal WhatsApp Account

A personal WhatsApp account is designed for individual use. It allows users to send messages, make voice and video calls, share files, and more for personal use. 

### 2. WhatsApp Business Account

WhatsApp Business is intended for small businesses to communicate with their customers. It has a separate app (WA Business) and offers additional features tailored for business use such as a business profile, quick replies, basic automated messages and labels. 

### 3. WhatsApp Business API Account

The WhatsApp Business API is designed for medium to large businesses to communicate with customers at scale. It acts as **a backend mechanism that allows businesses to manage and automate their conversations on WhatsApp**. Instead of a tangible app or interface that one might use on a personal device, the API is integrated into other messaging platforms (Messcat) or systems businesses already use.
