### Phase 2: Verify your Business on Meta

**Step to verify your Facebook Business**

To start business account verification, ensure eligibility and control over the account. If the "Start verification" button is not visible in the Security Centre, check if verification is required for desired features, based on any received notifications or emails. 

Misrepresenting information or unauthorised claims during verification can lead to denial of verification, removal of verified status, or additional actions by Meta.

❗ **Note**: Meta business accounts, sometimes called Business Manager accounts, are now called business portfolios. This change will appear gradually across Meta technologies.

## FAQ

1. **How to check if your business is verified?**
    
    ![How to check if business is verified (1).gif](How%20to%20get%20a%20Meta%20Business%20Manager%20Account%20and%20ver/How_to_check_if_business_is_verified_(1).gif)
    
    1. Log into your Facebook Business Manager account and click on 'Business Settings'.
    2. Select 'Security Center'.
    3. View the verification status displayed.
2. **What if the 'Start Verification' button is greyed?**
Meta may prevent your business from being verified if the submission does not meet the requirements for verification. This could include:
    1. Submitting, or being suspected of submitting false or misleading information
    2. Attempting to claim or verify a business account you don't own or have authorization to represent
    3. Trying to circumvent Meta's verification review system
    4. Having a website that fails to load, is not HTTPS compliant, or contains a link that leads to an error message
    
    If your business verification application was rejected, you may be eligible to appeal. Visit the Security Centre or return to where you began the verification process to learn more about the status of your verification.
    
3. **After I submitted my business details, I saw a list of business records. What should I choose if none of the businesses listed match?**
If META can find a public record that matches your business details, you will see a list of business records. You may either select the correct record from the list or select **My business isn't listed** or **None of these matches.**
4. **Do I need to submit documents if I use monthly invoicing to pay for ads?**
If you use monthly invoicing to pay for ads, you don't need to submit documentation for business verification. When you start the business verification process, you can fill in the form with your line of credit information and submit it. If you can't see that option, make sure that the business account you're trying to verify is linked to a credit line that you own, not one that is shared with another business.
5. **How long do I need to wait to know the verification decision after submission?**
After you've submitted your verification, a decision can be made in as little as 10 minutes and as long as 14 working days. You'll receive a notification when the review is complete. If you receive confirmation that your business is verified, there's nothing more you need to do.

💡 You can edit your business details at any time. However, any changes will require you to complete the business verification process again.
