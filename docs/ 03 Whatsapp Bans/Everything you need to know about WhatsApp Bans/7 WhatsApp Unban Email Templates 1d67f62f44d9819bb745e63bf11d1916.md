## **What to Do if Your WhatsApp Number is Banned**

If WhatsApp has banned your phone number, here’s a simple guide on how to ask them to unban it.

### **First Step: Ask for a Review in the App**

If you think WhatsApp banned your account by mistake:

1. Open WhatsApp on your phone.
2. You should see a message saying your account is banned. Tap **Request a review**.
3. WhatsApp will check your case. This might take some time.
4. You can open WhatsApp again later to check the status of your request.
5. **Important:** Sending more than one request will **not** speed up the review.
6. WhatsApp will send you a message in the app when they finish their review and make a decision.

Could you please reconsider and unban my number? WhatsApp is very important for my business [Explain briefly how, e.g., communicating with customers]. Losing it is causing problems [Explain briefly, e.g., difficult to contact customers].

Thank you.

- **Suggested Template:**

```
Dear WhatsApp Support,

I recently made several groups, and I think this might be why my number was banned. These groups were for a special community event I was organizing for my loyal customers [Explain briefly if possible].

I am sorry if making these groups broke any rules. I have reviewed the guidelines now and will be careful to follow them in the future.

Could you please restore my account? Connecting with my customers on WhatsApp is essential for [mention your business goal briefly].

- **Suggested Template:**

```
Dear WhatsApp Support,

I am writing to ask you to please reactivate my WhatsApp account that was recently banned. I believe it might be because I was using an external app to manage my account.

I truly did not know that using tools like this was against the rules. I have now deleted that app and made sure I am only using the official WhatsApp version from the app store.

I have learned my lesson and will only use the official app. Please consider unbanning my number, as it's important for [mention brief business need].

Thank you.
```

I am sorry that I broke the WhatsApp Terms of Service. I might have done this by mistake [mention briefly what you think you did wrong, if you know].
