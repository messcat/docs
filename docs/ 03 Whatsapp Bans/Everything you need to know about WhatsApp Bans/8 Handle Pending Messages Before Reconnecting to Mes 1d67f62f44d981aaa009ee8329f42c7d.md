# Handle Pending Messages Before Reconnecting to Messcat

Article Description: Essential to prevent another Ban. 


**Pending messages** occur when your WhatsApp channel disconnects from Messcat, preventing messages from being sent. This can result in a backlog of messages to be sent if disconnected for a few hours to a few days.

To minimize the risk of getting banned, especially after being unblocked by WhatsApp, it is recommended to clear/slowly reschedule pending messages before reconnecting to Messcat.

This guide also explains how to clear failed messages, which are messages that could not be delivered due to errors.

    - **Delete All Pending Messages and Reconnect**

    ### Understanding the Options
    
    - **Keep Pending Messages and Reconnect**: If messages were scheduled to be sent during the disconnection, they will immediately go out after reconnecting.
    - **Delete All Pending Messages and Reconnect**: Clears all pending/scheduled messages before reconnecting. This is the recommended option to avoid the risk of being flagged or banned.
    
    **Example Scenarios:**
    
    - If a message was scheduled to send within 5 minutes, but you reconnect after 10 minutes, it will send immediately.
    - If a message is scheduled for a day later, it will still be sent as planned after reconnection.
4. Click on **Delete All Pending Messages and Reconnect** to clear the pending messages.

## Clearing Failed Messages

Failed messages are those that were not sent due to errors and differ from pending messages. Follow these steps to clear failed messages:

1. Click on the **user menu button** in the **top-right corner** and select **Failed Messages**.
2. A list of all failed messages will appear.
    - Resend individual messages by clicking the **Send Message** button next to each failed message.
    - Alternatively, clear specific failed messages or take bulk actions:
        - **Clear All**: Deletes all failed messages.
        - **Resend All**: Resends all failed messages (⚠ This may pose a risk of being flagged or banned).
