Whatsapp Bans are instated by WhatsApp if their terms of service are violated and result in you being logged out of the App either temporarily with a timer, or permanently. 

If your Account has been banned by whatsapp, you can find out by opening the WhatsApp application on your phone. In cases where a number is banned or temporarily suspended, WhatsApp promptly displays a notification or message to inform the user. 

The app ensures that users are aware if any action has been taken against their number. It is important to understand the kind of ban it is and then deal with it accordingly. 

## Two types of Whatsapp Bans

1. **Temporary Ban –**  
A temporary WhatsApp ban is for minor policy violations, like using an unsupported version or spam-like activities(but not malicious). Users can't access their accounts for a few hours to several days, with a countdown showing the ban duration.
2. **Permanent Ban –** 
Permanent bans are for severe or repeated policy violations, such as harmful content, spamming, or being blocked by many users quickly. Once banned, an account can't be reactivated; users must start a new one with a different number. While WhatsApp’s decision may be final in majority of cases, an appeal can be made to get your account back.
