## **Steps to Implement:**

### **1. Identify Common Questions and Information:**

- Anticipate common questions viewers might ask during your live stream (e.g., product features, pricing, where to find resources).
- Prepare concise answers and relevant links or resources.

### **2. Create Keyword Triggers in Messcat:**

- **Trigger:**
    - Create a new "Facebook/Instagram Comment" trigger.
    - Set the condition: "Comment Text" contains a relevant keyword (e.g., "price," "feature," "link").
    - Set the condition: "Live Video Status" is "Live".

- **Action:**
    - Add a "Send Message" action.
    - Craft a private message (DM) containing the answer or resource link.
    - Example: "The price is $XX. You can find more details here: [link to product page]."

    - Repeat this step for each common question or information point.
- **Optional Action:**
    - Add "Add Tag" action.
    - Tag the user with something like "Asking Price" to track them.

### **3. Announce the Q&A Automation:**

- Inform viewers that they can ask questions using specific keywords.
- Clearly state the keywords and the type of information they will receive.
- Example: "If you have questions about pricing, comment 'price,' and I'll send you the details."

### **4. Monitor and Engage:**

- Monitor the live chat for questions and ensure the automated replies are being sent correctly.
- Address any questions that fall outside the automated responses manually.

### **5. Refine and Expand:**

- After the live stream, review the questions asked and the effectiveness of your automations.
- Add new keyword triggers and responses to cover more questions in future live streams.

## **Key Considerations:**

- **Accuracy:** Ensure the automated responses are accurate and up-to-date.
- **Conciseness:** Keep answers brief and to the point.
- **Relevance:** Provide information that is relevant to the live stream's topic.
- **User-Friendliness:** Use clear and simple language.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test your automations before going live.
