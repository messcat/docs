# How does Share Editing work?

Share Editing is a powerful feature that allows you and your team to **collaboratively edit automated message flows in almost real-time**, similar to how Figma enables collaborative design work. With Share Editing, you can work together seamlessly, seeing each other's cursors and changes as they happen.

To start collaborating, simply enter the **email or phone number** connected to your teammate's Messcat account. Once added, you can send them the link created for them to join the editing session.

Share Editing also gives you **control over who can view or edit** the message flows. You can easily manage access and permissions, ensuring that only the right people have the right level of access.

Additionally, Share Editing offers a **public view option**, which allows you to see real-time changes made by others without the ability to edit. This can be useful for sharing progress with stakeholders or for training purposes.
