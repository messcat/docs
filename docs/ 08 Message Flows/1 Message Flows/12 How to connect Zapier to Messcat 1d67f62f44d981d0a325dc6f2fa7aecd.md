Within the Action Node of Messcat, you can easily create a new Zap. This integration allows you to leverage any of Zapier’s functions, enhancing your workflows by automating tasks directly through your message flows. The key requirement is that the Zap must be newly created within Messcat, ensuring a seamless and tailored automation experience right from the start.

❗ You can only connect one Zapier Account at a time and all team members can use that account.

<aside>
❗ Only New Zaps can be created and no previously made Zaps can be used in message flows.
