# How to add my customers details to a message?

Learn how to use variables to personalise notification/broadcast messages. 

Do you want automate messages but also want personal attributes in them? 

You can do this using variables. Variables are properties such as name, number, country & even custom fields — which are different for all contacts. You can use them in the following ways–

- Insert {{name}} to any part of a message and it will fill with the name of contact automatically when sent
- Insert {{phoneNumber}} to fill the details automatically based on the contact's phone number during checkout
