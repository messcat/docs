### Tag

Add a tag to your contact based on their response or what button they select. Tags can help in organising data, making it easier to filter and search for specific information.

Ex: If a customer is interested in your product, you can tag them as a “lead” and in the future, you can send a broadcast message to all your “leads” using this tag as a filter

### Assign

Assign the contact to your teammate to ensure that your customer has a delegated personnel to reach out to and their query is completed

Ex: A customer is facing an issue with your product, so you assign the chat to your Customer Service agent

### Notify teammates

Send a notification to your teammate to keep them informed about important updates, changes, or tasks that require their attention

Ex: When you assign a new chat to your teammate, notify them so they don’t miss out on it

### HTTP Request

With this action, you can send HTTP(S) requests to external services or APIs. It allows you to connect Messcat with other systems and softwares

Ex: When a form is submitted in Messcat, you want to create a Google Calendar event
