# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: August 6, 2021


Here at  Messcat AI (referred to as “**we**”, “**our**” or “ **Messcat AI** ”), we are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. When you are using the services provided through our website, software, platform and application (the “**Services**”), you are agreeing to our rules and policies regarding your personal information and you expressly consent to us collecting, processing, using and storing your personal information, as described in this Privacy Policy.

**If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you must not use the Services.**

We hold personal information that you provide to us to set up and manage your account and the Services, and personal information generated in connection with your use of the Services ("**Administrative Information**"). We are the data controller of Administrative Information. This Privacy Policy informs you of your choices and our practices regarding your Administrative Information.

We also hold data, including personal information, that you submit, upload, transmit or display using the Services ("**Customer Data**") and we store this data solely in order to provide the Services. The terms relating to our storage and processing of Customer Data are set out in the Terms of Service and the Data Processing and Security Addendum (particularly in respect of personal data contained within the Customer Data (“**Customer Personal Data**”)). You are the data controller of Customer Personal Data and questions about data handling processes from your end customers or third parties regarding Customer Personal Data should in the first instance be addressed to you. At all times, we act as a service provider to you, and process data on your behalf. You can extract your Customer Data at any time.

**The Types of Personal Information We Collect and Process**

We will collect and use the following information about you:

- **Information you give us.** You may give us information about you by making an enquiry about our Services, using our Services or by corresponding with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise. This includes information you provide when you register for our Services (or for business customer, act as the company's business representative to register for Services), such as your name, username, email address, credit card information, telephone number and other information that helps us register you to use our Services.
- **Automatic Information.** We automatically collect certain information from you when you use our Services through the Messcat AI web portal, including IP address, User Agent and Device ID, and information regarding your use of our Services such as our log of your visits, site access requests, uploads and downloads.
- **Information that we obtain from a third party**. Messcat AI may, at times, allow administrators of the user account to determine access rights. In doing so, the administrator of your Services (which might be you) can include the email addresses of other persons who are to be given access to the Services under that account. If you are the administrator of the account, you acknowledge and undertake to us that you have the consent of the individual concerned to provide their email address for this purpose.
- We also collect and store your information each time you interact with Messcat AI , for example, when you communicate with us by email, activate new Services, or complete forms on our website. We also store information about the Services you purchase, such as the type of services or product you purchased, date of purchase, and information relating to any support issue.

**Cookies**

We use cookies and other similar technologies (e.g. web beacons, Flash cookies, etc.) ("**Cookies**") to enhance your experience using the Services. Cookies are small files which, when placed on your device, enable us to provide certain features and functionality.

You have the option to permit installation of such Cookies or subsequently disable them. You may accept all Cookies, or instruct the web browser to provide notice at the time of installation of Cookies, or refuse to accept all Cookies by adjusting the relevant function in the web browser of your computer. However, in the event of your refusal to install Cookies,  Messcat AI may be prevented from providing some of its Services available to you.

**How We Use Your Personal Information**

We will use the information in the following ways and in accordance with the following legal bases:

**How We Share and Store Your Personal Information**

We may share your personal information with selected third parties in and outside your country, including:

- **Third Parties** where we use a third party service to: (a) process payments; (b) fulfil orders for Services; (c) provide customer support; (d) send service notification; or (e) provide other services, support, features or functionality as part of the Services.
- **Law enforcement agencies, public authorities or other judicial bodies and organisations**. We disclose information if we are legally required to do so, or if we have a good faith belief that such use is reasonably necessary to:
- comply with a legal obligation, process or request;
- enforce our terms of service and other agreements, policies, and standards, including investigation of any potential violation thereof;
- detect, prevent or otherwise address security, fraud or technical issues; or
- protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users, a third party or the public as required or permitted by law (including exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction); and
- **Business Transfers.** We will disclose information to a third party in the event that we sell or buy any business or undergo a merger, in which case we will disclose your data to the prospective buyer of such business if your data is one of the transferred business asset. We will also disclose information to a third party if we sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, or sell some or all of our assets. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

**Third Party Links and Services**

Messcat AI may provide links to other third party websites as a convenience to you (collectively, the "**Third Party Websites**"). Please exercise care when visiting any Third Party Websites. The Third Party Websites have separate and independent privacy policies, notices and terms of use which govern your use of such websites and their use of any information they collect. We recommend you read these policies carefully.  Messcat AI disclaims all liability for personal information you provide to any Third Party Websites.

**The Security of Your Personal Information**

We use commercially reasonable endeavors to protect the personal data that you provide to us. We also employ several security techniques for transmission of personal data in registration information and payment information and the adoption of identity, credential and access management measures for transmission of such personal data to prevent security breaches and unauthorized access of personal data. We limit access to your personal data and other data to people who need access to such data for their work.

Nevertheless, no data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure. As a result, while we try to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal data you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. We cannot and do not guarantee security in connection with your use of our Services.

**Data Retention**

We retain your personal data as long as you have an account with us, as needed to provide services or products to you, to resolve disputes, to serve the purpose of research and statistical analysis or as required or permitted by applicable laws, such as tax and accounting laws.

Personal information, which has fulfilled the purpose for which it was collected or used, and has reached the period of time during which personal information was to be possessed, will be destroyed in an irreversible way. Personal information stored in electronic files will be deleted safely in an irreversible manner by using technical methods, and printed information will be destroyed by shredding or incinerating such information.

**Your Rights**

**This section ("Your Rights") applies to users who are located in the European Economic Area, Japan, Korea and Macau Special Administrative Region**.

You have certain rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you. Some of these only apply in certain circumstances as set out in more detail below. We also set out how to exercise those rights. Please note that we will require you to verify your identity before responding to any requests to exercise your rights. We must respond to a request by you to exercise those rights without undue delay and at least within one month (although this may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances) unless otherwise permitted by the applicable legislation.

**Access, Correction & Deletion**

You can access, correct and delete some of your data in the account portal at any time. If you believe there is any other personal information we process about you, or you are unable to correct or delete inaccurate information, you can make a request to us.

Please note, however, that we may retain personal information if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is the case.

**Restriction of Processing to Storage Only**

You have a right to require us to stop processing your personal information that we hold, other than for storage purposes, in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that if we stop processing the personal information, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims or for another's protection).

**Portability**

You have the right to receive a copy of certain personal information we collect from you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and a right to request that we transfer such personal information to another party. The relevant personal information is information you provided for the purposes of performing our contract with you (for example, your mobile number, email address, or transaction data).

**Objection**

You have the right to object to our processing of your personal information under certain circumstances (such as where that information is used with your consent, for example for marketing or profiling).

**Communications from Us**

If you have opted-in to the receipt of direct marketing from us, we may send you news and offers from time to time, for example; to reserve you a place on our events or webinars. You can opt-out anytime by contacting us at: [contact@messcat.ai](mailto:contact@messcat.ai) .

We may from time to time send you service-related announcements when we consider it necessary to do so (such as when we temporarily suspend the Services for maintenance, or security, privacy or administrative-related communications). You may not opt-out of these service-related announcements, which are not promotional in nature.

**Contact & Complaints**

Questions, comments and requests regarding this Privacy Policy are welcomed and should be addressed to us at [contact@messcat.ai](mailto:contact@messcat.ai) .

**In the event that you wish to make a complaint about how we process your personal information, please contact us at [contact@messcat.ai](mailto:contact@messcat.ai) and we will endeavour to deal with your request as soon as possible. This is without prejudice to your right to launch a claim with the data protection supervisory authority in the EU country in which you live or work where you think we have infringed data protection laws.**

**Terms of Service, Updates & Changes**

If you choose to use our Services, your use and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Terms of Service, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of Hong Kong. If you have any concern about privacy at  Messcat AI , please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice will change also. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy here. Such updated Privacy Policy will become immediately effective once posted here. Any information and/or personal data we hold about you (as described in this Privacy Policy and whether or not collected prior to or after the amended and restated Privacy Policy comes into effect) will be governed by the latest version of our Privacy Policy. Please check this page frequently to see any updates or changes to this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our Services signifies your acceptance of the changes to the Privacy Policy.

**CALIFORNIA ADDENDUM**

These additional disclosures are required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). This California Addendum does not apply to personal data that is not processed by us a business pursuant to the CCPA, such as any personal data processed by  Messcat AI on behalf of its customers.

During the preceding 12 months,  Messcat AI has collected, used, and/or disclosed the categories of personal data described above in our Privacy Policy. For example, depending on the Services you use, this may include your identifiers (e.g., IP addresses and email addresses), commercial information, audio information (e.g., recordings of customer support communications), and Internet and other electronic activity information. This may also include inferences we draw from the other information we collect.

We do not sell information, although we do share personal information in the ways described in our Privacy Policy.

We will not charge you different prices or provide different quality of services unless those differences are related to your information or otherwise permitted by law. Please submit your request by sending us an email to [contact@messcat.ai](mailto:contact@messcat.ai) . Once we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity, including by asking you to verify information about your use of our Services. If you would like to use an agent registered with the California Secretary of State to exercise your rights, we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf.

**EEA ADDENDUM**

This section of the Privacy Policy applies only if you are located in the EEA and supplements the information in this Privacy Policy.  Messcat AI is the controller of personal data only when it collects personal data and determines the purposes and means of processing that personal data. For example, when customers of our Services register an account with us or provide contact information in order to receive customer support, we are the controller of that data. When customers conduct their own services, customer relationship management activities or marketing campaign on our Services, we act as a data processor with respect to that data.

Our business may require us to transfer your personal data to countries outside of the EEA, including to countries that may not provide the same level of data protection as your home country, such as Hong Kong. We rely on the European Commission's model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries (i.e., the standard contractual clauses), pursuant to Decision 2001/497/EC (in the case of transfers to a controller) and Decision 2004/915/EC (in the case of transfers to a processor);

You may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you consider that our processing of your personal data infringes applicable law.
