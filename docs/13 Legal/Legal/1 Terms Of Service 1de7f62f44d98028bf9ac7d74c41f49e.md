1. **Trial Services**

13.1 Where the Customer submits an Order for Trial Services through Messcat AI’s product website, or otherwise executes an Order for the same, Messcat AI will make such Trial Services available to the Customer on a limited trial basis free of charge until the earlier of (a) the end of the applicable Free Trial Period; (b) the Commencement Date of any Services ordered by the Customer in substitution of such Trial Services; (c) the termination of the Services by the Customer pursuant to Clause 13.5 of this Agreement.

13.2 The Free Trial Period shall commence at the moment when the Customer has completed and submitted its Order for the Trial Services together with its payment details at Messcat AI’s product website [Messcat AI.paperform.co](http://Messcat.paperform.co/), and continue for a period of (i) up to sixty (60) calendar days or (ii) such other period as may be stipulated by Messcat AI prior to the provision of the Trial Services to the Customer. The  Free Trial Period may be suspended or extended at any time for any such period as determined by Messcat AI in its absolute discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, please refer to the following table which sets out the examples illustrating the manner in which the Free Trial Period shall be calculated and its corresponding commencement and expiry date ad time.

The Free Trial Period shall carry on and continue to run notwithstanding any delay or failure on the part of Messcat AI to provide or perform the Trial Services which is, either wholly or partly, caused by the Customer’s own omission, non-performance or failure to observe the foregoing obligations stipulated under this Clause 13.3.

13.4 Messcat AI shall grant the Customer, during the Trial Services, a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the Trial Services for the Customer’s internal evaluation purposes and not for any business or productive purposes. Any data the Customer enters into the Trial Services and any configurations made to the Trial Services by or for the Customer during the Free Trial Period will be permanently lost unless the Customer: (a) has purchased a subscription to the same Services as covered by the Trial Services; or (b) exports such data or configurations before the end of the Free Trial Period. There is no guarantee that features or functions of the Trial Services will be available, or if available will be the same, in the general release version of the Services, and Customer should review the features and functions of the Services before making a purchase. Messcat AI will be under no obligation to provide the Customer any maintenance or support services with respect to the Trial Services. Messcat AI may, in its sole discretion, discontinue Trial Services at any time.

13.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Messcat AI provides the Trial Services “as is” and “as available” without any warranties or representations of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Messcat AI disclaims all implied warranties and representations, including, without limitation, any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. The Customer assumes all risks and all costs associated with its use of the Trial Services. The Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy in case of any dissatisfaction or Messcat AI’s breach of these Terms with respect to such Trial Services is termination of the Trial Services.

13.6 Messcat AI will require the Customer to provide its payment details to access and start the Trial Services. By providing such details the Customer agrees that Messcat AI may automatically begin charging the Customer the Subscription Fees for the Services that the Customer has subscribed to immediately following the expiry of the Free Trial Period on a recurring annual basis or another interval that Messcat AI discloses to the Customer in advance. If the Customer does not cancel the Services before the end of the Free Trial Period, the Customer loses its right of withdrawal and authorizes Messcat AI to automatically charge the Customer for the Subscription Fees.  If the Customer does not want this charge, the Customer must cancel the Services before the end of the Free Trial Period by informing and contacting Messcat AI. The Services shall not be deemed to have been cancelled unless and until Messcat AI confirms to the Customer such cancellation in writing. The Customer acknowledges that (i) there will be no cooling-off period once the Initial Subscription Term commences following the expiry of the Free Trial Period, and (ii) there will be no full or partial refund(s) for the Subscription Fees once charged.
