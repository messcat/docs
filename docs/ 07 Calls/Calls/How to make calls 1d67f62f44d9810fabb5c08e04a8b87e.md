### **Credit Pricing for calls**

- **Per Minute Charging**:
    - Credits are charged per minute for calls. If the call duration is less than a minute, a full minute’s worth of credits will be deducted.
- **Call Duration**:
    - The call duration starts as soon as the call is made, not when it is picked up.
    - For example:
        - If the call duration is 1 minute and 23 seconds, credits will be deducted for 2 minutes.
        - If the call rings for 30 seconds but is not picked up, credits will be deducted for 1 minute.
