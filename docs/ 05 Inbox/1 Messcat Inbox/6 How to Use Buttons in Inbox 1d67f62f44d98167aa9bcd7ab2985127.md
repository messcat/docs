After clicking on buttons, you will be prompted with a box where you can write your own custom reply button.

❗ Only max 3 buttons can be added from the inbox.
Message buttons can only be sent out from WABA (WhatsApp Business API) accounts, otherwise they are sent as poll buttons as shown in the picture above. Refer to this doc.
