- **Focus on What Matters**: Filter your inbox to prioritize conversations that require immediate attention.
- **Boost Productivity**: Spend less time searching and more time engaging with customers.

## Available Filters

Here are the different filters you can apply to organize your inbox:

### **Channel**

- **Filter by Channel**: Sort contacts based on the channel where their number is saved (e.g., WhatsApp, SMS).

### **Tag**

You can apply tag filters in two ways:

- **Tag is**: Filters all contacts with the selected tag(s) applied.
- **Tag is not**: This works as an additional filter. For example, if you filter by **Tag is "A"** and want to exclude contacts with **Tag B**, you can use **Tag is not "B"** to display only contacts with **Tag A** but exclude those with **Tag B**.

Additionally, you can filter by:

- **Date Range**: When the tag was added.
- **Team Member**: Who added the tag.

### **Custom Fields**

Filter based on custom fields in two ways:

- **Selected Custom Field**: Shows contacts that have data within the selected custom field.
- **Custom is or is not**: Applies as a second condition for the selected custom field.

For example, filtering by **Birthday** with **is "January"** will show all contacts with a birthday in January. If you add **is not "February"**, contacts with a birthday in February will be excluded.

Additionally, you can filter by:

- **Date Range**: When the custom field data was added.
- **Team Member**: Who added the custom field data.

Example: Filter by the **"Purchase Value"** custom field to find contacts with a purchase value recorded by the sales team between January 1st and March 31st.

### **Assignee**

- **Filter by Assignee**: Filters contacts based on which team member they are assigned to. You can include or exclude contacts assigned to specific team members.

Additionally, you can filter by:

- **Date Range**: When the contact was assigned.
- **Team Member**: Who assigned the contact.

### **Ticket**

- **Filter by Ticket**: Sort contacts based on whether they have tickets in a specific CRM board or at a particular stage within that board.

### **More Options**

The **'More'** option provides additional filters:

- **Unread**: View messages you haven’t opened yet.
- **Archived**: View archived chats.
- **@Mentions**: View chats where you’ve been mentioned.
- **Unsolved Notes**: View contacts with unresolved notes/comments.
- **Groups**: Show only group chats in the inbox.
- **Individuals**: Show only individual contacts in the inbox.
- **Chats Not Replied**: Show chats that haven't been replied to.
- **Message Queue**: Show chats with pending or scheduled messages.
- **Failed Messages**: Show chats where messages could not be sent due to errors.
