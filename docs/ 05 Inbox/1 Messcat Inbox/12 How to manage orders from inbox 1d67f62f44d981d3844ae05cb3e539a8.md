# How to manage orders from inbox?


The user accesses the inbox order management feature directly from the inbox interface rather than navigating to the orders page.

You can also add a specific note to an order by clicking on add note in the three-dot menu.

### What is Order Status?

There are three types of status in inbox order management which can be used by the client as they see fit, but here is some explanation about the statuses:

### Types of Status

1. **Order Status**: This status is about whether the order is completed or not. It has three status options:
    1. Completed: The order has been paid for.
    2. Pending: The order is confirmed but not yet received by the customer.
    3. Cancelled: The order is cancelled.
2. **Payment Status**: This status is about whether the order is paid for or not. It has three status options:
    1. Paid: The order is confirmed and paid for.
    2. Pending: The order details are confirmed but the payment hasn't been done.
    3. Expired: The order payment link that was sent to the customer has expired.
3. **Shipping Status**: This status is about whether the order is shipped or not. It has four options:
    1. Delivered: The order has been delivered and received by the customer.
    2. Pending: The order shipping is pending i.e. It is not out for delivery to the customer or the customer didn't take the delivery
