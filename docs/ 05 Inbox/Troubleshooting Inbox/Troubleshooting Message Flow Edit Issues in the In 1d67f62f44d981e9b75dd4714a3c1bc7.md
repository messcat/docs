## **Problem**

When you try to edit a message using the "/" shortcut in the inbox, sometimes the changes aren't saved and the original message is sent instead. This issue occurs occasionally, particularly on older devices or with slower network connections. While this isn't a common problem, it can be frustrating when it happens.

## **Affected Devices**

- HP Laptop 15s-fq5xxx
- Lenovo IdeaCentre 510S-07ICB

## **Potential Causes**

- **Device Limitations**
    - Devices with limited processing power and memory may have trouble running complex web applications, causing glitches or delays.
    - Devices with outdated software or hardware are more likely to have compatibility issues.
- **Network Connectivity Issues**
    - Poor or unstable network connections can disrupt real-time updates and cause unexpected behavior.
- **Browser-Specific Bugs**
    - Some browser versions, particularly on older devices, have bugs that can affect text input fields.

## **Troubleshooting Steps**

1. **Check Browser Version:** Ensure you're running Chrome version 130.0.6723.92 or higher for best results.
2. **Clear Browser Cache:** Clear your browser's cache and cookies through settings for a fresh start.
3. **Try a Different Browser:** Switch to another supported browser, such as Chrome or Safari.
4. **Test on Different Networks:** Connect to a different network to determine if the problem is network-related.
5. **Test on Different Devices:** If available, access the application on another device to check if the issue persists.
