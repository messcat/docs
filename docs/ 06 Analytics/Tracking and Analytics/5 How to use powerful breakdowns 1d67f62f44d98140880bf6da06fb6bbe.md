4. **View the Breakdown Results**
    - Once you’ve selected your breakdown category, the chart or table will update to show you the data based on your chosen filter. For instance, if you selected **Country** for the **Messages Exchanged** chart, you will now see a breakdown showing how many messages were exchanged with each country.
