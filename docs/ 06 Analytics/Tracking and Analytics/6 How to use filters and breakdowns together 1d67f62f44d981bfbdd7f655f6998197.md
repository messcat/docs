### **How to Use the Filter and Breakdown Features Together**

You can combine the **Filter** and **Breakdown** features to gain more specific insights and design a powerful, customized dashboard.

### Example: Filtering and Breaking Down Messages Exchanged Data

    - Select the **Messages Exchanged** chart.
    - Click the **Filter icon** at the top of the chart.
    - From the available options, select **WhatsApp Business API (or any channel)** to filter the data by that channel.
    - The chart will now show only the messages exchanged via your WhatsApp Business API channel.
2. **Apply a Breakdown**
    - After applying the filter, click the **Breakdown (Line Chart) icon**.
    - Choose **Country** as the breakdown category.
    - Now, the chart will display a breakdown of messages exchanged by **Country**, but only for the filtered **WhatsApp Business API** channel.
3. **Result:**
    - The data now reflects the **WhatsApp Business API** channel and shows the number of messages exchanged, broken down by each country.

### **Combining Filters and Breakdowns**

This feature is flexible, allowing you to apply filters and breakdowns in multiple combinations depending on the data type. For example, you could filter by team member and break down by message type, creating a more powerful and customized view of your data.

This combination of filtering and breakdowns helps you dig deeper into your metrics, making it easier to analyze specific aspects of your business performance.
