# How to share your Analytics Dashboard with your team?


### Default Sharing of Analytics Dashboard

By default, your Analytics dashboard will be visible to your teammates to view. This will let them view the dashboard, and apply filters for their use, but they won’t be allowed to save these changes. This means that, the changes made will not be the default or apply to everyone’s board, just theirs, till the page is refreshed, or they get edit access. 

However, in some cases you may want to change the access your teammates have, giving them more access, to edit the dashboard, apply some changes and save them for everyone, or you may choose to hide the dashboard from them, restricting their access. 

### How to Edit Access?

**Step 1:** To edit access, find the share button, (only visible if you’re the owner of the board), and click on it.

**Step 2:** You will see the following Modal. Here you will see “All Teammates” as an option and also all your other teammates. Continue reading to learn more about how these options work.

**All Teammates** sets the default access level for all your teammates. If you want all your teammates to view, edit or have no access. Then make the changes to this option from the dropdown.

**Individual Teammate–** If you want to give access to some users that is more or less than your default, then you can select the individual teammate and change their access. This will not impact the default setting for the rest of your teammates, only the selected teammate. 

Helpful in scenarios where you might want to share your board to view with all your teammates, but give someone edit access, and also hide the board from some other member.

The teammates who have specifically modified access will not have Default written in their setting. 
If you change one of your teammates access, but change your mind later and want to give them the default level access, change their individual dropdown back to default.

**Step 3: Save your changes!** 

### **Some Important Notes on Edit Access and its Functionality**

- By default it should give all team members view access
- Allows sharing with "All Teammates" with say "edit" access but then give some specific teammate "view" access, i.e. allow teammate specific overrides.
- Should allow only users with edit access to change dashboard name and filters/data/etc.
- Only dashboard owners can delete the dashboard and share the dashboard
- Users with view access can make changes to their dashboard but cannot save. To save, read next point–
- If a user with view access makes some changes, and then without refreshing the page, acquires edit access from their teammate (their teammate gives them edit access on their end), it should change the users access automatically and let them save their changes (there should be no loss of changes).
