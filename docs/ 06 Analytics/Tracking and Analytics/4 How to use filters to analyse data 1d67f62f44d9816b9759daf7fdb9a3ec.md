# How to use filters to analyse data?

**How to Filter Your Data in Analytics**

The filter feature allows you to refine the data displayed in your charts by selecting specific conditions, making it easier to focus on the insights that matter most.

### Steps to Filter Your Data:

1. **Select a Chart**
    - Start by selecting the chart you want to filter. For this example, we'll use the **Messages Exchanged** chart.

2. **Access the Filter Options**
    - Click on the **Filter icon** (as shown in the image) at the top of the chart. This will open a list of filter options specific to the type of data in the chart.

3. **Choose the Filter Criteria**
    - From the list of available filters, you can choose how to refine your data. For example, if you want to see the breakdown of **Incoming** vs. **Outgoing** messages, you can select those options in the filter list.

4. **Apply the Filter**
    - Once you’ve selected your filter criteria (e.g., Incoming and Outgoing messages), the chart will automatically update to show only the filtered data. This allows you to focus on specific types of messages or other categories depending on your selected data.

### Example:

In the **Messages Exchanged** chart, selecting **Incoming** and **Outgoing** from the filter menu will show you the number of messages received and sent separately. This helps in analyzing specific patterns in messaging behavior, such as team performance in handling incoming messages versus outgoing communication efforts.
