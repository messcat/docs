# How to Use Forms



You can use your newly created **Forms** in message flow as it is available in the sidebar to attach to a message node.

## After attaching a form in message flows, you have two options for what happens next

- **When Form is submitted**
- **When Form is abandoned** (If the user made any change to the form but never submitted after 30 minutes, it will be considered abandoned).
