### Steps

1. Head over to tools>widget builder. 
2. Fill the information based on your preferences. 
3. Customise the look and feel of your widget.
4. Click on Save. 
5. Once Saved, copy the custom code generated and Paste in the <Head> tag of your website. 
6. Refer to the guides below!

You can also make changes to your widget after embedding it to your website without needing to paste the code again. Just click save and the changes will reflect on your website :)

### Shopify

To insert or modify code within the <head> section of your Shopify store, locate the "theme.liquid" file by navigating to Online Store > Themes > [Your Current Theme] > Actions > Edit code. You can then open and edit the Layout > theme.liquid file, and paste or insert your code snippet between the opening and closing <head> tags.

**Here's a more detailed breakdown:**

- **Accessing the Theme Code:**
    - Go to your Shopify admin and navigate to Online Store > Themes.
    - Click on Actions for your current theme.
    - Select Edit code to access the code editor.
- Finding the theme.liquid File:
    - The theme.liquid file is where the HTML structure of your entire theme is defined, including the <head> and <body> sections.
    - Open the theme.liquid file within the code editor, which can be found inside the Layout folder.
- Locating the <head> Tags:
    - Identify the opening <head> and closing </head> tags.
- **Inserting Your Code:**
    - Place your code snippet between the opening and closing <head> tags.
    - It's a good practice to add the code just before the closing </head> tag to avoid conflicts with other codes.
- **Saving and Publishing:**
    - Save your changes within the code editor.
    - Preview your changes by clicking "Preview" or visiting your store's URL.
    - If you duplicated your theme before making changes, you will need to publish the development theme once you are satisfied with the changes.
