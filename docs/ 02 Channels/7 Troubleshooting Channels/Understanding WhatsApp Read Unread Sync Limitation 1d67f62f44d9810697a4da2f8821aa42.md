## **Understanding the Issue**

We've noticed some instances where your messages in Messcat might not perfectly sync their **"read"** or **"unread"** status with WhatsApp. This is due to **technical limitations on WhatsApp**'s end that prevent us from always getting the correct action information. Essentially, you might occasionally see a message marked as "read" in Messcat but still showing as "unread" in WhatsApp, or vice versa.

## **Solution**

To ensure accurate Read and Unread status management within Messcat, we recommend disabling the "Chat Action Sync" feature. When disabled, Messcat will handle the read/unread status independently, providing a more reliable experience.

### **Here's how to disable Chat Action Sync**

1. Navigate to the **"Manage Channels" > Select Your WhatsApp Channel > 3-dot menu > Disconnect the Channel**
2. Click on the 3**-dot menu** next to the channel name and select "Show Advanced Settings."

- **Possible minor discrepancies with WhatsApp:** While we strive for consistency, there might be occasional differences in read/unread status between Messcat and WhatsApp due to the limitations mentioned above.
