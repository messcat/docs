## **Why is my message history not syncing completely?**

Messcat works with WhatsApp to help automate your messages. However, WhatsApp has some limits on how many old messages it can share with us.

## **Key Factors Affecting Sync**

1. **Message Volume:**
    - Large chat histories can take longer to sync, and some older messages might not be transferred completely.
2. **WhatsApp's Internal Limits:**
    - WhatsApp sets specific limits on how much message data can be synced, which affects how complete your message history appears.

## **How to Access Your Full Message History**

To view and search your complete message history, including older messages that may not be synced to Messcat:

1. **Check Your Primary WhatsApp Device:**
    - Your primary phone will always have the most comprehensive and up-to-date message history.
    - WhatsApp's search feature allows you to find specific messages or conversations, even if they haven't fully synced to our product.

We continuously strive to improve our integration with WhatsApp to minimize these limitations. For any specific issues or questions, please reach out to our support team.
