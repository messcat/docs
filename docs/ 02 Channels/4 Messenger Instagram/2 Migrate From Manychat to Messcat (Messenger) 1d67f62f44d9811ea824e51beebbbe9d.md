# Migrate From Manychat to Messcat (Messenger)

## **Why This Matters**

**Moving from Another App to Messcat**

If you're switching from another messaging app to Messcat for your Facebook Page, you need to tell Facebook to send your messages to Messcat instead of the old app. This is done by changing the "Primary Receiver." Without this step, you might not get any messages in Messcat!

## **What is a "Primary Receiver"?**

Think of it like a mailbox. Facebook needs to know which app should get your messages. The "Primary Receiver" is the app that Facebook sends messages to.
