# Advanced Comment Settings(Silencing Comments)

## Intro

**Do you find your inbox getting overwhelmed with comments, especially during live streams? Messcat's "Silence Comments" setting can help you manage the noise!**

This guide explains how to control which comment notifications appear in your inbox, allowing you to keep it clean and focused.

## **Why Silence Comments?**

If you have a very active community or frequently host live videos, the constant stream of comments can make it hard to find important messages. Silencing comments helps you:

- **Reduce clutter:** Hide notifications for certain types of comments.
- **Stay focused:** Prioritize direct messages and other important conversations.
- **Maintain automation:** Comment automations still work, even if notifications are silenced.

## **Here's How to Silence Comments**

**Step 1: Go to Manage Channels**

- Open your Messcat account.
- Navigate to "Manage Channels."

**Step 2: Open Your Channel Settings**

- Select the Messenger or Instagram channel where you want to adjust comment notifications.

**Step 3: Find "Silence Comments"**

- Scroll down within your channel settings to find the "Silence Comments" setting.

**Step 4: Choose Your Preference**

- You'll see four options. Choose the one that best fits your needs:
    - **None (default):**
        - All comments will send a notification and mark the chat as unread.
        - This is the standard setting.
    - **On Ongoing Live Videos:**
        - Comments made *during* live video streams will be silenced.
        - Comments received *after* the live video ends will still trigger notifications.
    - **On All Live Videos (Ongoing & Ended):**
        - All comments on live videos will be silenced, whether the video is currently live or has finished.
    - **On All Posts:**
        - All comments on all types of posts (regular posts, Reels, live videos, etc.) will be silenced.

## **Important Note on Silenced Comments**

- **Existing Chats:** If you already have a conversation with someone, their comments will still be visible in that existing chat in your inbox.
- **New Chats:** If someone comments and you *don't* have a previous chat with them, their comment will *not* create a new chat in your inbox. You will only see their comment if:
* They send you a direct message (DM).

## **Example Scenario**

You choose "On Ongoing Live Videos." During your live stream, comments won't clutter your inbox. However, if someone comments on the replay of that live stream later, you *will* receive a notification.

## **Key Takeaway**

The "Silence Comments" setting gives you granular control over comment notifications, allowing you to optimize your Messcat inbox for efficiency.
