</aside>

- **The Conversation Window:** Messenger has a rule that says:
    - You can message someone freely within 24 hours after they messaged you.
    - After 24 hours, you can only message them with a manually sent message. You must only use this to follow up on an issue, or provide assistance that couldn’t have been given in the first 24 hours. This window lasts for 7 days.
- **Old Messages:** Messages that existed *before* connecting to Messcat will not appear in Messcat.
- **Using Meta Business Suite:** If you use the Meta Business Suite to message people, those messages might not appear in Messcat. It's best to use Messcat for your Messenger messages after you connect.
- **File Size Limits:**
    - Pictures: 8MB limit
    - Other Files: 25MB limit

## Help! I'm Having Trouble!

- **Channel Connection Problems:**
    - Make sure you're logged in to the right Facebook account.
    - Double-check that your Facebook Business account is linked to a Facebook Page.
    - Verify that you've granted all necessary permissions to Messcat on the Manage Channel page.
- **Message Problems:**
    - Manage your messages only in Messcat to avoid sync issues with other platforms like Meta Business Suite.
- **Billing:**
    - If you're redirected to the payment page, your account has run out of credits.
