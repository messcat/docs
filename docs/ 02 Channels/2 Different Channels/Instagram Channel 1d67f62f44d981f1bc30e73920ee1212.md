### Steps

1. **Go to "Channels":** In Messcat, find and click on the "Channels" section. 
2. **Add a Channel:** Click the button that says "+ Channel." 
3. **Pick Instagram:** Choose "Instagram" from the list. 
4. **Log In to Instagram:** You'll be taken to Instagram to sign in to your account. 
5. **Give Messcat Permission:**
    - Choose the Instagram Business account and Facebook Page you want to use with Messcat.
    - You'll see a list of things Messcat needs permission to do. This is normal, and it lets Messcat manage your Instagram messages.
6. **Save Everything:** Click "Save" or "Confirm" to finish connecting. 
7. **All Done!** Your Instagram Channel is now connected to Messcat! You'll see it in your "Channels" section.

## **Important Things to Know**

- **Business Account Only:** Remember, you need an *Business* account, not a personal one.
- **Linked to Facebook:** Your Instagram Business account *must* be connected to a Facebook Page.
- **The 24-Hour Rule:** Instagram has a rule that says:
    - You can message someone freely within 24 hours after they messaged you.
    - After 24 hours, you can't message them first unless they message you again.
- **Old Messages:** Messages that existed *before* connecting to Messcat will not appear in Messcat.
- **Using Meta Business Suite:** If you use the Meta Business Suite to message people, those messages might not appear in Messcat. It's best to use Messcat for your Instagram messages after you connect.
- **File Size Limits:**
    - Pictures: 8MB limit
    - Other Files: 25MB limit

## Help! I'm Having Trouble!

- **Channel Connection Problems:**
    - Make sure you're logged in to the right Instagram Business account.
    - Double-check that your Instagram Business account is linked to a Facebook Page.
    - Make sure you've allowed all the permissions that Messcat needs.
- **Message Problems:**
    - Manage your messages only in Messcat to avoid sync issues with other platforms like Meta Business Suite.
- **Billing:**
    - If you're redirected to the payment page, your account has run out of credits.
