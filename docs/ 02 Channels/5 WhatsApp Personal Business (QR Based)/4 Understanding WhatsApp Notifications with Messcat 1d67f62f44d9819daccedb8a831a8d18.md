# Understanding WhatsApp Notifications with Messcat

About WhatsApp Notifications & "Online" Status with Messcat

## **Intro**

To help you manage your WhatsApp messages seamlessly, our platform centralizes message handling directly within your Messcat workspace. This means **you will no longer receive WhatsApp notifications on your mobile device** once your account is connected to Messcat. This is an intentional feature designed to streamline your workflow—not a technical error.

## **Why Does This Happen?**

When you connect your WhatsApp account to Messcat:

1. **Messcat Takes Over Message Management:** All incoming messages are routed to your Messcat dashboard instead of your phone.
2. **No Duplicate Notifications:** To avoid confusion and clutter, WhatsApp’s native notifications on your mobile device are automatically disabled.

This ensures all team members access messages from a single platform, improving collaboration and response efficiency.

## **Key Limitations to Note**

- 🔄 **Mobile Notifications Disabled:** You won’t receive WhatsApp message alerts, or status updates on your phone while connected to Messcat.
- 🌐 **Continuous "Online" Status:** Your WhatsApp may display "Online" 24/7 due to Messcat’s active connection. *This is expected behavior and does not impact functionality or privacy.*
- 📱 **Messages Are Still Accessible:** All chats remain visible and manageable through your Messcat interface (web or desktop app).
- ⚠️ **Reconnecting Restores Notifications:** If you disconnect your WhatsApp from Messcat, notifications on your mobile device will resume.
