# How to enable/disable Chat History Sync?

### **What is Chat History Sync?**

By default, Messcat syncs your WhatsApp chat history and makes it available in the inbox. The time taken to sync this history depends on the size of your chat history.

Due to limitations of a QR based integration discussed earlier in this section, there might be some possible data loss during such a chat history sync, depending on the data sent to us by WhatsApp. This is a platform limitation.

Chat history sync is enabled by default. However, you can choose to disable chat history sync depending on your requirements.

**Some possible cases where you may want to disable chat history sync.**

1. You do not want older chat history to sync on Messcat.
2. You want to speed up the connection process and do not need chat history.
3. You want to connect another number in the same channel (not advised) and want to preserve history from the older channel.

### **How to Enable/Disable Chat History Sync**
