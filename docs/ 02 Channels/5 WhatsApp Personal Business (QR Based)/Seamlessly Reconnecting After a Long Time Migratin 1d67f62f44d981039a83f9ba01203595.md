# Seamlessly Reconnecting After a Long Time/Migrating to a New Number

How to seamlessly migrate a channel to a new number, or reconnect the same number after changing to a new phone, or just reconnect after a long time

Changing the WhatsApp phone number connected to a channel in Messcat is a straightforward process. Following this guide will ensure you do not lose any running automations nor your chat history on Messcat.

Note: Any groups you were part of with the old number will have to be rejoined. Till then, you won’t be able to message on those groups

You can follow this guide in case your phone number got banned, and you’re reconnecting the same number, or you installed the same phone number on a new phone or simply reconnecting after having been disconnected for a while

1. On the Messcat dashboard, navigate to the [Manage Channels](https://www.app.Messcat.tech/root-inbox/channels) page

2. Locate the channel that you want to change the number for and click “Scan QR”

1. You will be prompted to disconnect your current phone number. Click “OK”.

2. If you are worried about the WhatsApp sync overriding the archive, pin, unread chats on your system, disable “Native Chat Action Sync” before reconnecting. You can read more about this in our guide [here](https://help.Messcat.tech/channels/7CJ14joY5QWstXQmUwxMXx/understanding-chat-action-sync/3ERGcvXVFGkpdJWnjVVgbN)

3. You may be prompted with a message in case you had lots of pending messages queued up. This can happen if you were disconnected for a long time & had some automation triggering new messages — but these could not be sent out as you were disconnected.
To avoid being banned & loss of the scheduled messages — choose the recommended action here. The order of the messages being sent is preserved.

    **Note:** if your new number does not have history with the chats you messaged with the old number, and you have dozens of chats that have pending messages — this can potentially result in a ban. In this case, you can choose to “Delete All Pending Messages” too
    
4. Finally, scan the QR with your new phone number and you have your new channel connected with a new number! Any previously synced messages & chats will be there & merged with any new data that comes in from the new number

## Starting With a Fresh Inbox

In case you require a fresh inbox for your channel but want to keep all the tags & contacts, you can go to the advanced settings of the channel & use the “Remove Data” functionality.

This will keep all contacts, tags, assignees, notes & scheduled messages — but will remove synced chats & messages. Please keep in mind — this **action cannot be undone**
