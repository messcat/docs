# What is Chat Action Sync?

Chat Action Sync is a feature designed to keep your **WhatsApp and Messcat** experiences aligned. It synchronizes actions like **pinning, archiving, and marking messages as read or unread** between the two platforms. This means that changes you make in one app will be reflected in the other.

## Why Might It Not Always Work Perfectly?

Due to technical limitations on **WhatsApp's** end, we can't always receive accurate action information. This can prevent seamless synchronization, leading to minor discrepancies between the platforms in read/unread status or chat organization.

## When Should You Turn Off Chat Action Sync?

Here are simple reasons why you might want to turn off Chat Action Sync:

- **Separate Control:** When you want to handle your chats action differently in WhatsApp and Messcat
- **Privacy:** When you don't want your WhatsApp chat action to show up in Messcat
- **Testing:** When you want to try Messcat features without changing anything in WhatsApp
- **Quick Break:** When you need to temporarily pause sync due to issues or personal preference
- **Channel Connection Problems:** When your WhatsApp channel keeps disconnecting and affecting your operations

## How to Disable Chat Action Sync ?

If you prefer to manage your chats independently in each app, you can disable Chat Action Sync:

1. Navigate to the **"Manage Channels" > Select Your WhatsApp Channel > 3-dot menu > Disconnect the Channel**
2. Click the 3-dot menu and choose Settings.
