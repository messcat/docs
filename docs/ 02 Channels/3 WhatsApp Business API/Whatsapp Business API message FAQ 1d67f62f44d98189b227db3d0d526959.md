# Whatsapp Business API message FAQ


### Why don’t special characters like exclamation marks etc. show up in a Button message?

If you tried adding special characters to a button on a whatsapp message, and saw that the message goes without those characters, it’s because whatsapp does not allow for special characters to be added on buttons. So we omit them automatically, otherwise the message would be cancelled.
