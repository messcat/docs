# If you delete your basic WhatsApp Messenger/Business App account:

- You can’t regain access to your account.
- It may take up to 90 days from the beginning of the deletion process to delete your WhatsApp information. Copies of your information may also remain after the 90 days in the backup storage that WhatsApp uses to recover in the event of a disaster, software error, or other data loss event. Your information isn’t available to you on WhatsApp during this time.
- It doesn’t affect your information related to the groups you created or the information other users have relating to you, such as their copy of the messages you sent them.
- WhatsApp may retain certain log data in our databases even after you delete your account, but such data will be disassociated from any identifying information such that it can no longer be linked to your account. To do this, on a regular basis, WhatsApp wipes certain identifying information from this log data, and replaces any instance of your account ID with a replacement identifier which cannot be linked back to your account once it is deleted.
- WhatsApp may also keep your information for things like legal issues, terms violations, or harm prevention efforts.
- Please refer to WhatsApp’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#privacy-policy) for more information.
- Your information shared with other [Meta Companies](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/the-facebook-companies) will also be deleted.
