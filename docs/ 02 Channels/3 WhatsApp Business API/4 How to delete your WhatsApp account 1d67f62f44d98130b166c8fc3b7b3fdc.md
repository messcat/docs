# How to delete your WhatsApp account?

# Intro

- To apply for **WhatsApp Business API**, you must use a number that does not have an account on any WhatsApp app.
- You can use a phone number that is already registered in the Android, iPhone, or Business application versions of WhatsApp.
- However, to register this phone number on WhatsApp Business API, you will need to follow the steps below to delete the WhatsApp account associated with that phone number.

**Once a phone number is registered on the WhatsApp Business API, it cannot be used for WhatsApp Business or the WhatsApp consumer app. A phone number can be upgraded to the WhatsApp Business API, but not downgraded.**

# Steps

1. Open WhatsApp.
2. Android: Tap [**More options**](https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/troubleshooting/finding-the-more-options-icon) > **Settings** > **Account** > **Delete my account**.

3. Enter your phone number in [full international format](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/contacts/how-to-add-an-international-phone-number) and tap **DELETE MY ACCOUNT**.
