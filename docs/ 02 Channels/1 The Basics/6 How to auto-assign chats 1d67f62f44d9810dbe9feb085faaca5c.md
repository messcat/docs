### **Step 4: Choose Assignment Method**

- You'll see options for auto-assigning teammates. Here are the two common methods:
    - **Smart Assign:** This option automatically assigns chats to the teammate with the fewest currently assigned chats.
    - **Round Robin Assign:** Select multiple teammates for this method. Chats will be automatically assigned to each teammate in a sequential order, ensuring a balanced workload.
