# AI ChatBot FAQs

1. **What data can I use to train the AI ChatBot?**

        📌
        
        **Note**: The system cannot process duplicate file names. To update an existing file, you must upload it with a different name. The system will then use the most recently uploaded version.

    - Website URLs: Add your website's URL, and the bot will crawl embedded links to fetch content.

        📌
        
        We do not support Google Docs because they have anti-scraping mechanisms in place and use client-side rendering for content.

2. **How long does it take to train the chatbot?**
    
    The training time depends on the volume of data. Smaller files or websites typically take a few minutes, while larger data sets may take significantly longer.
    
3. **Can I disable the chatbot from auto-responding?**
    
    Yes. You can disable **“Enable Auto Reply”** in the settings. If you still want the bot to suggest replies, enable **“Use as AI Assistant”** instead.
    
4. **Can I assign chats to teammates if the bot cannot respond?**
    
    Absolutely. Use the **“Select Teammate”** option when configuring the chatbot. If the bot cannot respond, it will automatically assign the chat to the chosen teammate.
    
5. **How do I include or exclude sources in the chatbot’s responses?**
    
    You can control this using the **“Include Sources in Chatbot Response”** option. If enabled, the bot will display sources/links at the bottom of its replies. If disabled, responses will exclude sources.
    
6. **What happens if I train the chatbot with incorrect or irrelevant data?**
    
    The chatbot will use any uploaded data as its knowledge base. If the data is incorrect, you can upload updated or corrected files to replace previous data. For websites, ensure the content is accurate before fetching.
    
7. **Can I retrain the chatbot with new data?**
    
    Yes, you can retrain the chatbot anytime. Add or replace files, re-fetch a website’s data, and click the **“Train Chatbot”** button again to process the updated data.
    
8. **What happens if my website has restricted content?**
    
    If certain parts of your website are restricted, the chatbot will not fetch those links or pages. Ensure all necessary pages are publicly accessible for the bot to extract information.
    
9. **Can I use the AI ChatBot for multiple channels?**
    
    Yes. Simply go to **“Select Channel”** in the settings and choose the channels where you want the bot to respond.
    
10. **Can I customize the chatbot’s tone or behavior?**
    
    Yes. Use the **“Prompt”** field to instruct the chatbot on its behavior, tone, and response style. For example:
    
    - “Be professional and concise.”
    - “Use a friendly and conversational tone.”
    
11. **Can I train different chatbots for different purposes?**
    
    Yes. You can create multiple chatbots with unique knowledge bases and configure each one to handle specific queries or channels.
