- **Other Payment Methods**: Please refer to your payment provider for their specific processing times.

## **6. About Refund Amount, Processing Fee and Currency Conversion**

Please be aware that **full refunds are not available**. Any approved refund will incur a **non-refundable processing fee** ranging from **8-15%**, as charged by our payment gateway (e.g., Stripe). This fee covers transaction costs and cannot be waived.

Refund amounts may differ from your original payment due to fluctuations in exchange rates at the time of processing.

- The exchange rate used will be based on the current rate during the refund transaction, not the original purchase date.
- For further details on exchange rates or any additional bank fees, please consult your bank directly.

🚨🚨🚨 **Messcat is not responsible for discrepancies caused by currency conversion or additional fees imposed by your financial institution.**

🚨🚨🚨 **All first-year subscriptions are non-refundable once the payment is processed. Refund requests will only be considered for renewals or duplicate charges. No refunds will be granted for any subscription within the first year, regardless of circumstances.**

## **7. Non-Refundable Items**

The following items are non-refundable:

- **One-Time Purchases**: Credits top up, upgrades, or custom features are not eligible for refunds.
- **Promotional Discounts**: Subscriptions purchased with promotional codes are non-refundable.
- **Trials and Free Plans**: Services offered as part of a free trial or complimentary plan are not eligible for refunds.

## **8. Policy Changes**

Messcat reserves the right to modify this Refund Policy at any time. Updates will be posted on our website, and continued use of our services indicates acceptance of the updated terms.
