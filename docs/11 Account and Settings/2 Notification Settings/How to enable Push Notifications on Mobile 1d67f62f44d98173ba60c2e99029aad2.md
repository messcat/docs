2. **Home Screen App Users:** If you have Messcat on your home screen, it's recommended to delete the current version and re-add it. This will ensure you have the latest updates and features. 
3. **iOS Compatibility:** Notifications are supported on devices running iOS 15 and later. If you're having trouble receiving notifications and your device meets this requirement, please contact our customer support for help.
