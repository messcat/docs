You can manage access for your teammates, limiting which information they have access to. This could be helpful in multiple cases where you would not want your teammates to see your clients contacts or other information. 

Follow the steps below to find how you can manage access for your Teammates.

**Step 1. Access Team Settings**

- Open your Messcat dashboard and hover over the left-side menu and locate “**Settings**”.
- Within settings, click on the **"Team"** section.

**Step 2. Select Team Member**

- You'll see a list of your team members. Tap on Manage Access for the Team member you’d like to change permissions for.

## Roles

You may select one of these roles for your teammates, depending on what type of permissions you want to give them:

- **Team Owner:** Has full control over all team settings and member access.
- **Admin:** Can access all functionalities but cannot manage the Team Owner role.
- **Agent:** Can create and access messages using message flows and keyword replies. They can only see chats assigned to them.
- **Editor:** Can create and edit content (like messages and tags), but cannot delete everything. They also cannot view billing information.
- **Viewer**: Can view most features. Does not have edit access.
