![credit pricing.png](What%20is%20Credit%20System%20and%20How%20does%20it%20work/credit_pricing.png)

# Intro

## **Buy a Credit Subscription**

- Subscribe to a credit subscription where you get a certain number of Messcat Credits every billing cycle.

## **Use credits to use the App**

- Your Messcat credits get consumed as you use the app. You only get billed for services you use.

## **Top up as you go!**

- You can top up your credit balance if you run out of credits before the credit renewal date. Ideal for holiday campaigns!

# Steps

| **Top-up Methods** | **One-Time Top Up** | **Subscription** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Payment** | You buy a specific amount of credit upfront and use it as needed. There's no commitment or recurring payment. | You pay a fixed fee (quarterly or yearly) for access to certain features or a set amount of in-app currency. |
| **Renewal** | No automatic renewal. You manually top up again when credit runs out. | Automatically renews at the end of the term (monthly or yearly) unless you cancel it before the billing cycle. |
| **Bonus Credits** | Typically no bonus credits are offered. | Offer bonus credits (10% extra for subscribing to a yearly plan) |
| **Flexibility** | More flexible. You can top up with any amount whenever you need it. | Recurring charges. You're locked into the fixed amount of credits or features included in your chosen plan for the entire term. |
