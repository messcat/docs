## How to Use Filters

You can filter your contact list based on the following attributes:

### **1. Chat**

- **Filter by Individual Chats or Groups**: You can filter contacts based on their chats or groups.
- **Unread Messages**: Filter contacts based on whether they have unread messages from you.

### **2. Tag**

You can apply tag filters in two ways:

- **Tag is**: This filter shows all contacts that have the selected tag(s) applied.
- **Tag is not**: This works as a second condition. For example, if you filter by **Tag is** "A", and want to exclude contacts with **Tag B**, you can select **Tag is not "B"**. This will show contacts with **Tag A** but not **Tag B**.

Additionally, you can filter based on:

- **Date Range**: When the tagwas added.
- **Team Member**: Who added the tag.

### **3. Custom Fields**

You can filter based on custom fields in two ways:

- **Selected Custom Field**: This shows all contacts that have data inside the selected custom field.
- **Custom is or is not**: This works as a second condition for the selected custom field.

For example, if you filter by **Birthday** and select **is "January"**, you'll get all contacts with that exact birthday. Then, if you add **is not "February"**, you'll exclude contacts whose birthday is in February.

Additionally, you can filter based on:

- **Date Range**: When the custom field data was added.
- **Team Member**: Who added the custom field data.

For example, you can filter by the **"Purchase Value"** custom field to find contacts whose purchase value was recorded by the sales team between January 1st and March 31st.

### **4. Channel**

- **Filter by Channel**: You can filter contacts based on the channel where their number is saved (e.g., WhatsApp, SMS).

### **5. Assignee**

- **Filter by Assignee**: You can filter contacts assigned to specific team members. You can use "is" and "is not" conditions to include or exclude contacts assigned to particular team members.

Additionally, you can filter based on:

- **Date Range**: When the contact was assigned.
- **Team Member**: Who assigned the contact.

### **6. Ticket**

- **Filter by Ticket**: You can filter contacts based on whether they have tickets in a particular CRM board or at a specific ticket stage within that board.

### **7. Message Received**

- **Filter by Received Messages**: You can filter contacts based on the number of messages they have sent to you, using greater than and less than filters.

### **8. Message Sent**

- **Filter by Sent Messages**: You can filter contacts based on the number of messages you have sent to them, using greater than and less than filters.

### **9. Last Contact is**

- **Filter by Last Interaction Date**: You can filter contacts based on the date of their last interaction with you, selecting a specific date range using the calendar picker.
