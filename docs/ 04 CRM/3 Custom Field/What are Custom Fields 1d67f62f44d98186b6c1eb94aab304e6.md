## How to use custom Fields?

Let's take an example here, as you saw in the visual above, I have created a custom field named "**Company**", which includes the 3 options - "**Pepsi**", “**CocaCola**”, “**Messcat**”. So you must be thinking about how to use it.

Well, we can use this custom field in the inbox. When you write '**{**', a dropdown of all your custom fields will appear. You can select the one you want, and it will send the data inside the custom field as the message.

In this case, when you select the "**Company**" custom field in the dropdown and send the message, it will appear as "**Pepsi**" in the chat.
