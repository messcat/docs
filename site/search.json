Meta may prevent your business from being verified if the submission does not meet the requirements for verification. This could include:</li> <li>Submitting, or being suspected of submitting false or misleading information</li> <li>Attempting to claim or verify a business account you don't own or have authorization to represent</li> <li>Trying to circumvent Meta's verification review system</li> <li>Having a website that fails to load, is not HTTPS compliant, or contains a link that leads to an error message</li> </ol> <p>If your business verification application was rejected, you may be eligible to appeal.

What should I choose if none of the businesses listed match? If META can find a public record that matches your business details, you will see a list of business records.

If you use monthly invoicing to pay for ads, you don't need to submit documentation for business verification. When you start the business verification process, you can fill in the form with your line of credit information and submit it. If you can't see that option, make sure that the business account you're trying to verify is linked to a credit line that you own, not one that is shared with another business.</li> <li>How long do I need to wait to know the verification decision after submission? After you've submitted your verification, a decision can be made in as little as 10 minutes and as long as 14 working days. You'll receive a notification when the review is complete. If you receive confirmation that your business is verified, there's nothing more you need to do.</li> </ol>  💡 You can edit your business details at any time.

See our quick 5 minute guide here</li> <li> <p>Once we have a message node, let’s start editing</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>As we start typing out, place a curly brace (<code>{</code>) where you’d like to place the customer’s name, and immediately you’ll see a dropdown open. This dropdown will show you all the variables you can use </p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>At the top of the list, you’ll see “contact name” — that’s the variable for the name of the contact this message will be sent to. Click the down arrow on your system to highlight this &amp; press enter to add it to your text</p> </li> <li> <p>Voila! The variable has been added to the message. Now, whoever receives this message will see their own name being sent.

And as you can see below, the name got replaced with the contact’s name (which was set as “AD”)</p> <p></p> <p></p> </li> </ol> <p>And there you have it — a simple &amp; effective way to reduce toil and personalise your flows!</p>","path":[" 08 Message Flows","3 Variables","Intro to Variables"],"tags":[]},{"location":"%2008%20Message%20Flows/3%20Variables/2%20Intro%20to%20Apps%20&%20Variables%201d67f62f44d9812994fec94c9d76c860/","level":1,"title":"Intro to Apps &amp; Variables","text":"<p>Article Description: Use variables &amp; apps to automate your business</p> <p>App nodes are a powerful way for your flows to interact with the Messcat ecosystem &amp; the rest of the world. You can do everything from creating a ticket, asking GPT a question to requesting data from your own servers.</p> <p>This power can be compounded by chaining multiple apps together that pass information between each other via variables.</p> <p>We’ll attempt to build an automated flow where all incoming inquiries are passed to our trained chatbot, and then if the chatbot couldn’t answer the query — we’ll create a ticket for it and notify our customer service (CS) teammate.</p> <p>For the impatient of you, you can play with the created flow by clicking here</p> <ol> <li> <p>We’ll start by setting up our AI chatbot, which you can do here</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Next, let’s create a Kanban board where we’ll put all customers whose queries the chatbot couldn’t answer, and need manual attention. You can create one in the CRM here. We’ve created a simple one here with 2 stages:</p> <ol> <li>Customers will first be put into the “Open” stage</li> <li>Once we’ve answered their query, we’ll close their ticket &amp; move into the “Closed” stage</li> </ol> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Once the chatbot is setup, we’ll create a message flow and add an “Incoming Message” trigger. This trigger will start the flow whenever we receive any message from our customers. We’ll attach a condition node after it.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Next, we’ll add some conditions.</p> <ol> <li> <p>First, from the trigger node — we’ll add a condition node to it.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Next, we’ll check if the customer messaging us doesn’t already have an open ticket. We do this because if the AI isn’t able to answer a customer — if the customer texts again, the AI shouldn’t respond again to avoid spamming the customer with nonsense.</p> </li> <li>We achieve this by clicking the “Add Condition” variable &amp; accessing the “Ticket Stage” variable &amp; then ensuring no open ticket exists via an “is not” condition</li> </ol> <p></p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Next, we’ll connect the condition to an “AI Chatbot” node.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Click “Choose Next Step” and select “AI Chatbot”</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Add the integration we created step 1</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>To pass the incoming message’s text to the chatbot, so it can process it — we’ll use the “Text” variable. We’ll access this by pressing the <code>{</code> key since “Input Text” is a free text field.</p> <p></p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Once we get a response from the AI chatbot, we’d want to check if the bot was able to actually give a meaningful response. If so, we’d want to forward the response back to the user.</p> <ul> <li> <p>We’ll can do so by adding a condition from the AI chatbot node, and checking if “Successful Response” is true — i.e. the AI chatbot managed to generate a successful response</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>We’ll connect a message node when this condition matches, and there — we’ll use the textual output of the AI chatbot &amp; send it back to the customer.

If the data is incorrect, you can upload updated or corrected files to replace previous data. For websites, ensure the content is accurate before fetching.</p> </li> <li> <p>Can I retrain the chatbot with new data?</p> <p>Yes, you can retrain the chatbot anytime.

This California Addendum does not apply to personal data that is not processed by us a business pursuant to the CCPA, such as any personal data processed by  Messcat AI on behalf of its customers.</p> <p>During the preceding 12 months,  Messcat AI has collected, used, and/or disclosed the categories of personal data described above in our Privacy Policy. For example, depending on the Services you use, this may include your identifiers (e.g., IP addresses and email addresses), commercial information, audio information (e.g., recordings of customer support communications), and Internet and other electronic activity information. This may also include inferences we draw from the other information we collect.</p> <p>We do not sell information, although we do share personal information in the ways described in our Privacy Policy.</p> <p>We will not charge you different prices or provide different quality of services unless those differences are related to your information or otherwise permitted by law. Please submit your request by sending us an email to contact@messcat.ai .

For example, when customers of our Services register an account with us or provide contact information in order to receive customer support, we are the controller of that data. When customers conduct their own services, customer relationship management activities or marketing campaign on our Services, we act as a data processor with respect to that data.</p> <p>Our business may require us to transfer your personal data to countries outside of the EEA, including to countries that may not provide the same level of data protection as your home country, such as Hong Kong. We rely on the European Commission's model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries (i.e., the standard contractual clauses), pursuant to Decision 2001/497/EC (in the case of transfers to a controller) and Decision 2004/915/EC (in the case of transfers to a processor);</p> <p>You may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you consider that our processing of your personal data infringes applicable law.</p>","path":["13 Legal","Legal","Privacy Policy"],"tags":[]}]}
